# The Problem With Comments

It's hard to imagine the web without comments. They're everywhere. However, comments now seem to exist in certain places simply because of its legacy. New networks and technologies have sprung up since mass adoption of commenting and are arguably better suited for conversation. On a side note, have you read many comments lately? It's often hard to understand how our societies function after spending 5 minutes skimming through YouTube comments.

Tackling the subject of internet comments is far too expansive for this post. This entry is a critique on commenting around the written word and a proposed alternative. 

## The three main problems with comments

### They're noisy

Comments are a jumbled, unorganized mess *before* touching the subject of blog spam. *Anyone* can say *anything*&mdash;and the problem is that they do. There's considerable evidence that many readers [do not fully read written content](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html). Throw in the safe assumption that *many* of the people commenting are not fully reading the article and it makes the problem even worse.

This noise is rarely beneficial for the writer or even the reader for that sake. Why then have it be a part of the content?  

### They're passive
Comments were a good first attempt for readers to interact with content creators. It was a *huge* step up from its alternatives (e.g., mailing a letter to the editor). But comments still aren't *truly* interactive. The comment section is typically used as a place where readers are given the opportunity to "discuss amongst themselves".  Their thoughts, opinions and suggestions rarely, if ever, inform the content it relates to.

My theory is that this segregation greatly contributes to the low quality of comments. There's no way for readers' to shape/improve a piece of content--and therefore they have no "skin in the game". Why would a reader invest the time to contribute a well-thought-out contribution if the author doesn't value it? This passive format of communication does not encourage meaningful creator/consumer interaction. That doesn't mean it can't or doesn't happen. It does&mdash;*despite* its shortcomings.

### They're unproductive (for everyone)
The two problems above lead to the reality that comments are ultimatey a waste of everyone's time. They're chatter that is quickly forgotten, deleted or never seen to begin with. At best, it's wasting the commenters' time, at worst, it's also wasting the author's time due to the effort to moderate, delete and cull comments. Instead of creating more/better content, they're babysitting. 

## Replace comments with genuine reader interaction

There needs to be a tighter and reciprocal relationship between reader and writer. Readers should have the opportunity to provide concrete, directed feedback to improve a writer's work. In short, a pull request for writing&mdash; which is why I'm writing on Github. This relationship raises the role and expectations of the reader and blurs the line of ownership between her and the writer. It provides an inroad for co-creation and co-ownership of written content. Most importantly, it focuses the interaction around content on improving it.  

### This model creates a (positive) barrier to entry 
Not everyone *should* contribute to certain content. Rather than fostering a free-for-all environment for discourse, writers should be expect a level of subject acumen from their readers as a prerequisite to contribute. In other words, foster a meritocracy rather than democracy. This could potentially force people to either do their homework or forever hold their peace.

### Contributions should mean something
Opinions are like noses, everybody has one. Few have solutions. An accepted edit/revision into a piece of content should be an accomplishment. There also needs to be credit/acknowledgement to those who contribute. This means writers are going to have to loosen the reigns on their content and show an openness towards public contributions. For people working on open source projects, it's second nature. For a lot of writers, this is going to be different and uncomfortable.

### Let the general conversation happen elsewhere
The behavior of "commenting" on content&mdash;including written content is increasingly migrating to social networks. This trend is real and positive. It creates a clear outlet for people not interested in contribution or direct interaction. If someone wants write an undirected gush/rant about your work, let that stay on Twitter or Facebook. Meanwhile, you can focus on making your work better.

### Facebook pages is a scary place to let the comments live
Many blogs create Facebook pages for their blog and publish their posts there. It works, but there could be some concerns about giving up content to Facebook. And Facebook makes it too easy to publish directly on the pages. And finally, as of my knowledge today, when you've reached 5000 followers, you lose control of the Facebook page, and Facebook will convert it to a public group. 

## We need new tools

The online written word is the most accessible form of media for consumers to contribute to. There's a clear opportunity in this space, the tools just do not yet exist. Writing on Github is my attempt to prototype this concept on the closest tool I could find. But clearly, this approach is a square-peg-in-a-round-hole hack.

### prose.io

I'm just sitting and writing in prose.io using my browser. Here I'm able to write directly in Markdown and save it.

**Unorganized Notes**

* About new tools.

To get prose.io and Jekyll and Github pages installed was a major hurdle on Maverics. There was some compability issues between XCode 5.1 and ruby that took hours to solve.[Github Pages, Jekyll, and Mavericks, Oh My!](http://michaeljdeeb.com/blog/github-pages-jekyll-mavericks/) however, solved it.

* Comments rarely, if ever directly lead to a better final product. 
	* Critique/Feedback is invaluable and comments can provide insight into general sentiment. 
	* Concrete results are missing

* It's not a conversation
	* It's a monologue followed by a collection of disparate monologues. 
	
* "Comments" have been replaced with status updates. 
	* Better in ways, worse in others
	* Still disparate monologues
	* Meaningful conversations cannot happen in chunks of 140 characters
	

* The best way to share an idea is to let others be a part of it.
	* The best way for others to be a part of it is to let them help give it shape.
	
* Collaboration around writing can take many different forms
	* Critique  
	* Editing
	
* No more armchair quarterback
	* Have a problem with a post? Make is better.
	* Let's have conversations result in meaningful results.
	* Think you can do it better? Fork it and prove it
